Plagiarism is a serious academic offense that involves presenting someone else's work as your own. It can take the form of copying text, ideas, code, or other intellectual property without proper attribution. Most educational institutions have strict policies against plagiarism, and violations can result in severe consequences such as failure or expulsion.
